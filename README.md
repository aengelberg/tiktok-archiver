TikTok Archiver is a tool for batch-archiving all the videos in your TikTok account.

It is very different from other third-party TikTok downloading services (SnapTik, SaveTok, etc):

* It processes an archive file that you must first [request and download](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data) from TikTok.
* It downloads all of the videos from your account, including private and friends-only videos.
* All of the videos will be unwatermarked, at the original resolution and quality that was uploaded to TikTok.

## How it works

First, you must [request and download](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data) a full archive of your TikTok account through the TikTok app. This archive usually takes about 3 days to receive after requesting it. You may select either the TXT or JSON format when requesting the data from TikTok.

After downloading and unzipping your archive, you will have a file named `Posts.txt` or `user_data.json`, which will contain a list of links to download each of your videos.

This application automatically sifts through that file, and batch-downloads every video to a folder on your hard drive.
